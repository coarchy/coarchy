Cloning an organization allows you to make a copy of one of your existing organizations, or start fresh from a template. All your data including vision, statements, actors, process stories are copied over. 

For the following elements, you get granular control over whether they should be copied over, moved, or ignored:
- Organization Users  
- Checklists
- Products
- Product Evaluations

Please note that Copying/moving product evaluations require you to copy/move products. For a high-level overview of the logical flow of the cloning process, please review the diagram below:
